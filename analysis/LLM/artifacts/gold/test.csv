The project focuses on the first two phases of Grand Challenges Canada's (GCC) innovation platform. In the first phase, GCC provides small grants to innovators to conduct research and develop promising innovative ideas to address MNCH challenges. The second phase includes testing and piloting innovations, developing strategic partnerships, leveraging private sector funding and know-how and business and marketing plans to enable their further development. In this phase, funding is awarded to Canadian and LMIC innovators who have demonstrated their innovation works and can be prepared for take up by the private sector, international organizations and LMIC governments.","Innovation Platform for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health/Plateforme",NONE,,

The avian influenza virus is a type A virus that is highly mutable. Traditional vaccine strategies against the influenza A virus are susceptible to the emergence of epidemic strains that are beyond vaccination coverage. In addition, there is no vaccine strategy applied to farmed birds affected by the influenza A virus, therefore the emergence of a flu epidemic results in the destruction of livestock to prevent the virus from spreading. The long-term objective of this research project is to develop a new generation vaccine that is inexpensive, easy to administer, and has a broad spectrum to fight the various strains of avian influenza virus.","Nanostructures for the development of vaccines against avian influenza virus NANOSTRUCTURES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES AGAINST AVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS The influenza virus causes upper respiratory tract infections in humans, avian species, and a variety of mammals.

The long-term objective of this research project is to develop a new generation vaccine that is inexpensive, easy to administer, and has a broad spectrum to fight the various strains of avian influenza virus. The concept of 'various strains' refers to the use of 'universal' epitope antigens conserved in various strains of avian influenza virus to provide cross-protection. Thus, two highly conserved viral epitopes are targeted. State-of-the-art technologies developed in two laboratories will be combined: nanotechnology and a new adjuvant. These approaches will allow simple production of nanoparticles that do not require any special containment, as opposed to traditional vaccines produced in embryonated eggs. This project is a collaboration between the Université du Québec à Montréal and the National Institute for Agricultural Research (France). The Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund is a partnership of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada, and IDRC. It represents a joint investment of CA$57 million over five years to support the development, production, and commercialization of innovative vaccines against priority livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.",NONE,,

The initiative will target the Cherangany water tower, one of the five forest ecosystems of strategic importance for Kenya, where environmental restoration and forest protection activities will be implemented, thus contributing to Kenya's 'National Determined Contribution (NDC)' and to the implementation plans of the green agenda. The project will benefit two counties, West Pokot and Elgeyo - Marakwet, as well as those bordering the ecosystems concerned. The initiative proposes to implement activities for i) strengthening forest governance, ii) improving the production capacity of certified and quality seedlings, iii) piloting and dissemination of appropriate technologies for tree cultivation and environmental recovery, and iv) raising awareness and mobilizing communities and the private sector to ensure their active participation in forest management. Forest governance structures will be strengthened to increase the capacities of national and county agencies to intervene in the protection and management of forest resources. These actions will favor the sustainable management of natural resources with an increase in tree cover, the restoration of degraded areas, and consequently a reduction in CO2 emissions.", FORESTS_LAND,"SDG15.2,SDG15.3",
