Emerging trends across Africa that pose risks to rule of law and USAID development objectives include executive overreach, complex transnational threats, high levels of impunity, and closing political space all of which are important to U.S. National Security interests. This two-year activity will develop guidance to strengthen rule of law approaches to address organized crime (e.g., illicit trafficking in wildlife, persons, conflict minerals and other natural resources, counterfeit pharmaceuticals). This activity will: (1) explore the key dynamics between various forms of organized crime and rule of law in sub-Saharan Africa, (2) catalogue USAID programming globally that addresses the key dynamics between ROL and organized crime, and (3) summarize lessons learned - including experiences beyond USAID - in addressing these dynamics."

The initiative will target the Cherangany water tower, one of the five forest ecosystems of strategic importance for Kenya, where environmental restoration and forest protection activities will be implemented, thus contributing to Kenya's 'National Determined Contribution (NDC)' and to the implementation plans of the green agenda. The project will benefit two counties, West Pokot and Elgeyo - Marakwet, as well as those bordering the ecosystems concerned. The initiative proposes to implement activities for i) strengthening forest governance, ii) improving the production capacity of certified and quality seedlings, iii) piloting and dissemination of appropriate technologies for tree cultivation and environmental recovery, and iv) raising awareness and mobilizing communities and the private sector to ensure their active participation in forest management. Forest governance structures will be strengthened to increase the capacities of national and county agencies to intervene in the protection and management of forest resources. These actions will favor the sustainable management of natural resources with an increase in tree cover, the restoration of degraded areas, and consequently a reduction in CO2 emissions."
