Because of the important role that wetlands play in ecosystems and biodiversity, WI's work focuses primarily on the conservation of wetlands and their biodiversity, but with strong elements of socio-economic development for the communities that live in and depend on them.The project builds in part on WI's ongoing work in Guinea-Bissau, Ethiopia, India and Indonesia, where the landscapes are at different stages of development. In Guinea-Bissau and Ethiopia, the work is still ongoing, and next steps include developing policies and a plan for sustainable development and employment in the area. In India and Indonesia, the 'final stage' of the landscape approach has been reached, and these landscapes constitute so-called 'Lighthouses' that will continue to serve as good examples of the application of WI's landscape model. A completely new initiative, based in Bangladesh, is starting in the Sundarbans, one of the world's largest mangrove forests shared by Bangladesh and India.", WATER_MARINE,"15.1, 15.5",

Traditional practices of subsistence agriculture are characterized by a low use of inputs and high vulnerability to soil deterioration and increasingly variable climactic conditions. Agricultural conservation aims to increase soil fertility and water retention, while also reducing tillage and erosion through environmentally sustainably farming practices. In so doing, it is an effective way to improve the food security and livelihoods of the poorest male and female farmers in East Africa.The project targets the families of 18,000 male and female farmers (of which 40% are female headed households) for a total of 90,000 beneficiaries in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. The project is based on three core activities: 1) support to productivity through technical support services (e.g. minimum tillage, soil protection with crop residue, synergy between farming and agriculture, etc.), the establishment of groups savings and the development of links between the public and private sectors to increase capital production of male and female farmers, 2) networking between individuals and organizations to provide information and technical assistance, and 3) political influence and awareness to incorporate agriculture conservation in broader national policy in the target countries to benefit the greatest number.The project is implemented in collaboration with the following local partners: Ethiopia – FH Ethiopia (formerly Food for the Hungry Ethiopia), Migbare Senay Children and Family Support Organization, Terepeza Development Association, Kenya – Anglican Development Services in Mount Kenya, Central Rift and Western District, SASOL Foundation, and the Utooni Development Organizations and in Tanzania– African Inland Church of Tanzania Diocese of Geita and Mara/Ukerewe, and the Diocese of Central Tanganyika Development Services Company./Le projet a pour but de mettre à l'échelle les résultats obtenus et les innovations développées par la Canadian Foodgrains Bank (CFGB) en agriculture de conservation lors de projets précédents auprès des fermiers et fermières les plus pauvres de l'Afrique de l'Est.

SeedsGROW 2 is an extension and continuation of the current SeedsGROW 1 program to which Sida contributes with a total of SEK 171 millions during the 2013-2018 period. There are some lessons learned from Phase 1, as Oxfam prepares for phase 2. These are, the importance of the Farmer Field Schools and how these can evolve, and how the campaign around the food value chain has increased understanding among consumers, businesses and governments. SeedsGROW 2 will consist of two components 'Sowing Diversity = Harvest Security (SEK128 millions) and GROW (SEK 62 millions). Brazil, Pakistan and Thailand are exporters of various global goods and are important to many companies targeted by the GROW campaign, where the goal is to highlight the major inequalities affecting poor food producers. The overall objective of SeedsGROW 2 is to contribute to a global food system that is just and sustainable, that supports the rights of small-scale food producers- men and women-, that guarantees food and nutrition security and that promotes the sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity within the context of a changing climate. The target groups for both SD = HS and GROW are indigenous peoples and small farmers - women, men and youths. The objective of the program is that indigenous people enjoy their rights and have the capacity to access, develop and use plant genetic resources to improve their food security, including food nutritional value, despite climate change.The four pillars of the program, including four outcomes in the theory of change, are expected to be mutually reinforcing and contribute to the overall objective.Outcome 1, Strengthening of Plant Diversity, aims to make indigenous peoples and small-scale communities more resistant through access to, use and management of plant genetic resources, both in terms of food safety, nutrition, disaster management and adaptation to climate change.Outcome 2, Markets - aims to strengthen security of supply and secure access to seeds through the creation and availability of markets for high quality seeds adapted to farmers' needs.Outcome 3 is called Neglected and Underutilized Species (NUS) - the expected result is to strengthen the resilience of local communities by increasing the nutritional value of food through the promotion of NUS, thereby strengthening biodiversity, which is also beneficial to health and community resilience.Outcome 4, Policy and Institutions aims to provide stakeholders support for the possible political and institutional framework for banding seed systems and implementation of farmerâ€™s rights.b).

Economic studies have estimated annual losses in India and Tanzania at US$57 million and US$46 million respectively.","Development and deployment of a vaccine against babesiosis DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF A VACCINE AGAINST BABESIOSIS Babesiosis is a disease that affects cattle, water buffaloes, and African buffaloes.

Babesiosis occurs in many parts of the world where the ticks are present, including Africa and Asia, and its prevalence and incidence are often underestimated. Economic studies have estimated annual losses in India and Tanzania at US$57 million and US$46 million respectively. Current vaccines against babesiosis consist of live attenuated pathogens produced from the blood of infected animals, although parasites grown in the lab are also available as vaccines in some parts of Latin America. While vaccination of young animals results in solid lifelong immunity, current vaccines are not safe as they may cause adult animals to become infectious, may be contaminated with other pathogens, or may cause hypersensitivity reactions. This project aims to generate a dual vaccine that is designed to block parasite infection of host capillary blood vessels and transmission by tick vectors. Using cutting-edge bioinformatics and experimental platforms, babesia bovis red blood cell surface-exposed proteins will be tested for their ability to induce antibodies that block adhesion of infected blood cells to blood vessel walls, and hence prevent acute disease. Similarly, bioinformatic tools will be used to identify conserved babesia bovis candidate antigens exclusively expressed in the tick stages of the life cycle of the parasite. A combination of these two sets of antigens will then be developed into a vaccine and used in a disease-challenge study in cattle. Thus a dual-purpose vaccine with capacity to prevent clinical disease and babesia transmission will be developed and will have potential for refinement into a commercial vaccine. This project is a collaboration between the United States Department of Agriculture and Australia-based Monash University. The U.S.-based Washington State University Pullman and the Bioscience East and Central Africa (BecA)-ILRI Hub in Nairobi, Kenya will also participate as sub-grantees.
