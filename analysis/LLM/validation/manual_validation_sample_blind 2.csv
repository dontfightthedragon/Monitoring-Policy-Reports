Although there have been improvements and developments of the road network of the southwest zone, links with the rest of the country across the Padma river are still via ferries. Transport capacity of ferry services is very limited, and waiting time at ferry ghats is about one hour for buses/light vehicles and two hours for trucks. In addition, riverbanks of the Padma river are very unstable and the river width changes frequently, which results in approach ghats being temporarily depending on the seasons. Therefore, expansion of existing ferry terminals is difficult due to these unstable river conditions. Moreover, there is an urgent need to replace existing dangerous ferry/launch operations between Dhaka and the southwest region by more safety and reliable surface transport system. Overloaded vessels frequently sink in this waterway route passing through near the risky-prone zone of turbulent confluence of the Padma and Meghna rivers.The social, economic and industrial underdevelopment of the southwest zone, which encompasses Bangladesh's second major port, Mongla, its third main city, Khulna, and the inland port at Benapole, is in part due to difficult access across the Padma river to the rest of the country. If a bridge to cross the Padma River is constructed, it will certainly strengthen the linkage between the southwest and north central zones. A highway bridge, in particular, will improve and enhance the freight and passenger transportation between Dhaka and major points in the southwest zone and contribute substantially to the regional development of the southwest zone as well as to national economic growth.The TA Loan will assist the Government in preparing the detailed engineering documents and procurement of the Padma Bridge construction.", NONE, NONE

This project involves and supports organizations in eleven countries individually and as a network (six African and five non-African) to facilitate the use of evidence from policymakers and stakeholders in order to clarify development problems and causes, frame options to address them, and identify implementation considerations. Supported through a co-funding partnership between IDRC and Hewlett, the project will build on the experiences and expertise of these organizations in informing health policies to test whether the mechanisms used in health systems — such as rapid response services, stakeholder dialogues, and citizen panels — can be adapted and used by other social actors. The aim is to build conducive environments and systems for evidence-informed policymaking about social systems generally, and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals in particular. The project will study if and how the piloted mechanisms work and their effectiveness in facilitating the use of evidence by policymakers in the non-health sector. It will also explore if and how the strength of participating organizations, as well as their relationships with other organizations in each country's ecosystem of policy-supporting organizations, increases over time.

2022FID199700,"FID - Cooking to electricity to the help of deforestation in the Virunga Fid National Park - Cooking electricity to the help of deforestation in the Virunga National Park The establishment of an electric cooking mode as an alternative to charcoal could make it possible to stop the massive deforestation in progress in the oldest African natural park located east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project carried out by the Environment Center for Environment-Montpellier (EEC-M), aims to replace the use of biomass with an electrical self-cook. The FID funding for the impact assessment will in particular be used to test different methods to support its adoption and measure its influence on the protection of the forest. The assessment financed by the FID will make it possible to test different methods of supporting the adoption of self -buyers and measuring the impact of the adoption of the new cooking mode offered on the use and demand for charcoal. Context: in Goma, more than 90% of households use charcoal to cook. Wood plantations are not large enough to meet the exponential demand for fuel. Consequently, the majority of demand is satisfied by illegally produced coal produced by armed groups in the protected forests of the Virunga National Park listed as a UNESCO World Heritage. The Innovation: the project co-developed by ECE-M, the Virunga Foundation and the University of Antwerp, starts from the hypothesis that the gradual replacement of wood coal by using an electrical pressure cooker Deforestation, reduce household energy expenditure, and participate in peace in the area. The project consists of providing families with an electrical pressure cooker, entirely subsidized by the social enterprise supplier of hydroelectric energy, Virunga Energies, 100 % owned by the Virunga Foundation, in charge of management of the National Park with the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation. The resulting increase in electricity expenditure would eventually create a return on investment for the company, while reducing the demand for charcoal. The asvaluation funded by the FID will make it possible to test different methods of supporting the adoption of self -buyers, via subsidy of equipment and electricity and activities of awareness of environmental issues, and measure the impact of the adoption of the new way of cooking On the use and demand for charcoal. The expected results: the adoption of the electric self-cook by targeted families reduces the demand for coal and, consequently, the illegal income of the smugglers, and improves the efforts of conservation of one of the largest tropical forests in the world.* Progressive replacement of charcoal cooking by electricity* subsequent use of electricity* Progressive elimination of illegal consumption of charcoal* weakening a source of income",FORESTS_LAND, 15.2,15.3

In 2011, the Migratory Shorebird Project (MSP) established an international partnership to understand and reverse those and other causes of shorebird declines along the Pacific Flyway. This project will use information gathered by MSP to locate and protect critical sites for shorebirds. Objectives are to secure the legal protection of 2130 acres of shorebird habitat, reduce the disturbance experienced by shorebirds on over 260,000 acres in 8 WHSRN sites, increase knowledge about the impacts of habitat loss on shorebirds populations wintering along the Pacific Flyway, and increase the capacity of local groups and national agencies in 9 countries to assess shorebird populations and implement management practices beneficial to shorebird habitat.", WILDLIFE_SPECIES, 15.1,15.5

2010006152UGA1,"Wildlife-related Zoonotic Diseases among Pastoralists in Uganda WILDLIFE-RELATED ZOONOTIC DISEASES AMONG PASTORALISTS IN UGANDA Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are of increasing concern worldwide. Most of these diseases are of animal origin (zoonotic). While risk of zoonotic disease is related to wildlife-livestock-human interaction, it is amplified by poverty, environmental degradation and social vulnerability. The East African context presents a high-risk situation. Livestock and wild animals come into close contact while using limited water resources and pastures near national parks and tourist resorts. Disease transmission from wildlife to livestock and people affects community development, public health, food security, wildlife protection and business (tourism, value chains). Using an Ecohealth approach, researchers will conduct a serological survey to determine the distribution of major zoonotic diseases among pastoral communities, livestock and wildlife in proximity to a national park. They will carry out ecological, social and economic studies to assess the impact of such diseases on public health and income generation (value chains, tourism).", WILDLIFE_SPECIES, 15.5
