The avian influenza virus is a type A virus that is highly mutable. Traditional vaccine strategies against the influenza A virus are susceptible to the emergence of epidemic strains that are beyond vaccination coverage. In addition, there is no vaccine strategy applied to farmed birds affected by the influenza A virus, therefore the emergence of a flu epidemic results in the destruction of livestock to prevent the virus from spreading. The long-term objective of this research project is to develop a new generation vaccine that is inexpensive, easy to administer, and has a broad spectrum to fight the various strains of avian influenza virus.","Nanostructures for the development of vaccines against avian influenza virus NANOSTRUCTURES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES AGAINST AVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS The influenza virus causes upper respiratory tract infections in humans, avian species, and a variety of mammals.

The long-term objective of this research project is to develop a new generation vaccine that is inexpensive, easy to administer, and has a broad spectrum to fight the various strains of avian influenza virus. The concept of 'various strains' refers to the use of 'universal' epitope antigens conserved in various strains of avian influenza virus to provide cross-protection. Thus, two highly conserved viral epitopes are targeted. State-of-the-art technologies developed in two laboratories will be combined: nanotechnology and a new adjuvant. These approaches will allow simple production of nanoparticles that do not require any special containment, as opposed to traditional vaccines produced in embryonated eggs. This project is a collaboration between the Université du Québec à Montréal and the National Institute for Agricultural Research (France).

Traditional practices of subsistence agriculture are characterized by a low use of inputs and high vulnerability to soil deterioration and increasingly variable climactic conditions. Agricultural conservation aims to increase soil fertility and water retention, while also reducing tillage and erosion through environmentally sustainably farming practices. In so doing, it is an effective way to improve the food security and livelihoods of the poorest male and female farmers in East Africa.The project targets the families of 18,000 male and female farmers (of which 40% are female headed households) for a total of 90,000 beneficiaries in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. The project is based on three core activities: 1) support to productivity through technical support services (e.g. minimum tillage, soil protection with crop residue, synergy between farming and agriculture, etc.), the establishment of groups savings and the development of links between the public and private sectors to increase capital production of male and female farmers, 2) networking between individuals and organizations to provide information and technical assistance, and 3) political influence and awareness to incorporate agriculture conservation in broader national policy in the target countries to benefit the greatest number.The project is implemented in collaboration with the following local partners: Ethiopia – FH Ethiopia (formerly Food for the Hungry Ethiopia), Migbare Senay Children and Family Support Organization, Terepeza Development Association, Kenya – Anglican Development Services in Mount Kenya, Central Rift and Western District, SASOL Foundation, and the Utooni Development Organizations and in Tanzania– African Inland Church of Tanzania Diocese of Geita and Mara/Ukerewe, and the Diocese of Central Tanganyika Development Services Company./Le projet a pour but de mettre à l'échelle les résultats obtenus et les innovations développées par la Canadian Foodgrains Bank (CFGB) en agriculture de conservation lors de projets précédents auprès des fermiers et fermières les plus pauvres de l'Afrique de l'Est.

Economic studies have estimated annual losses in India and Tanzania at US$57 million and US$46 million respectively.","Development and deployment of a vaccine against babesiosis DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF A VACCINE AGAINST BABESIOSIS Babesiosis is a disease that affects cattle, water buffaloes, and African buffaloes. It is caused by babesia bovis, a parasite transmitted by ticks. This parasite hides in red blood cells and evades immune responses, resulting in a persistent infection that often results in death. Babesiosis occurs in many parts of the world where the ticks are present, including Africa and Asia, and its prevalence and incidence are often underestimated. Economic studies have estimated annual losses in India and Tanzania at US$57 million and US$46 million respectively. Current vaccines against babesiosis consist of live attenuated pathogens produced from the blood of infected animals, although parasites grown in the lab are also available as vaccines in some parts of Latin America. While vaccination of young animals results in solid lifelong immunity, current vaccines are not safe as they may cause adult animals to become infectious, may be contaminated with other pathogens, or may cause hypersensitivity reactions. This project aims to generate a dual vaccine that is designed to block parasite infection of host capillary blood vessels and transmission by tick vectors. Using cutting-edge bioinformatics and experimental platforms, babesia bovis red blood cell surface-exposed proteins will be tested for their ability to induce antibodies that block adhesion of infected blood cells to blood vessel walls, and hence prevent acute disease. Similarly, bioinformatic tools will be used to identify conserved babesia bovis candidate antigens exclusively expressed in the tick stages of the life cycle of the parasite. A combination of these two sets of antigens will then be developed into a vaccine and used in a disease-challenge study in cattle. Thus a dual-purpose vaccine with capacity to prevent clinical disease and babesia transmission will be developed and will have potential for refinement into a commercial vaccine. This project is a collaboration between the United States Department of Agriculture and Australia-based Monash University. The U.S.-based Washington State University Pullman and the Bioscience East and Central Africa (BecA)-ILRI Hub in Nairobi, Kenya will also participate as sub-grantees. This project is funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund, a partnership between the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada and IDRC.

Waste is culturally seen 'not in my backyard (NIMBY)' issue. The mindset of considering waste as a 'please in my backyard (PIMBY) philosophy is at its infancy, if exists at all. Most people do not know, hence undervalue, the energy, food production and soil enrichment potential of waste. They also are unaware of the health danger of invisible enemies such as drinking water and food contamination from poorly managed waste. There is a critical need to show that small scale, off-grid bioenergy systems do work, that they are sustainable and are capable of delivering solutions to waste management, power generation, food and soil security and improve people's health and well-being in peri-urban/informal and rural communities. The demonstrator pilots will encompass the collection of waste materials, their sustained processing through AD and the realisation of product values. They will be integrated into 2 distinct community-based settings: a small, domestic system associated with a community school in Accra, Ghana and a larger university campus-based activity in UniBen, Nigeria. Evidence from the demonstration pilots will enable potential investors and policy makers in both Nigeria and Ghana to have the technical and social evidence and confidence that these systems can work in situ beyond the laboratory. They represent the first and vital step for our partner organisations (CGE Nigeria, UNiBen, CSIR and LU Ghana) to take a lead in commercially growing business opportunities through entrepreneurial leadership in this domain. The ambition, objectives and workplan for ACTUATE emerge from Lancaster's deep engagement with researchers and research users in sub-Saharan Africa through several GCRF-funded research and capacity-building projects. Africa is a strategic priority for Lancaster which is currently the only UK University to have a campus on the continent. In addition to our long-standing partnership building in Ghana and Nigeria, Lancaster University has grown national leadership in eco-innovation - innovation supporting both business growth and the environment.

The partnership uses an ecohealth approach to address the complexity of emerging infectious diseases. This project presents a new phase of APEIR research on emerging threats from antimicrobial resistance and wildlife trade. It aims to strengthen the field of ecohealth and enhance emerging infectious disease control in Asia through research, capacity building, social and policy advocacy, and stronger knowledge and response networks.

A significant portion of this burden is preventable, but most countries in the region lack the research capacity to analyze environmental health risks and assess policy implications. In addition, government infrastructure for environmental health monitoring, regulation, and enforcement is limited. To tackle these multi-dimensional challenges, this project aims to establish a regional hub of training and research excellence in eastern Africa with Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The primary focus is to reduce the effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for high and rising rates of disease and death in the region. The project is being implemented under the Global Environmental and Occupational Health initiative led by the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health in collaboration with Canada's International Development Research Centre. The overall research component of the hub is led by Ethiopia's Addis Ababa University in collaboration with Uganda's Makerere University, Maasai Mara University and Great Lakes University of Kisumu in Kenya, and the University of Rwanda. The research component is closely integrated with a tailored training program for research leaders in the region headed by the universities of Southern California and Wisconsin-Madison.","East African GEOHealth hub for preventing environmental and occupational health risks EAST AFRICAN GEOHEALTH HUB FOR PREVENTING ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RISKS The burden of disease from environmental and occupational health hazards and climate change is a growing concern in eastern Africa.

The primary focus is to reduce the effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for high and rising rates of disease and death in the region. The project also addresses emerging occupational health and safety problems from climate change in agriculture. Pilot research aims to analyze and reduce occupational heat stress in key industries of the region (e.g., flower greenhouses), engaging industry to validate models for predicting current and future health risks to workers. The long-term objectives of the project are to build capacity and leadership in eastern Africa for conducting cutting-edge multidisciplinary health research, extending a solution-oriented research portfolio to other countries, and addressing key priority problems in the region on environmental and occupational health.

During EU for Innovation phase 1, Sida has played an important role in boosting the innovation ecosystem in Albania, through creating and implementing Innovation Challenge Fund based on Swedish experience. The fund, has been relevant and responsive to the needs of 40 Albanian start-ups, innovation supporting organisations and enterprises through the provision of the missing support in their validation and growth phases, in absence of similar government or donor funding facilities to support such business ideas in Albania. Therefore, the Fund filled a gap in financing of innovative ideas, and in this way contributed to the growth of innovative businesses across the country, with engagement of women-led start-ups and businesses as well as those who would not have otherwise been able to transform their ideas into actual business activity. Following the positive outcomes, and the request from the government of Albania to further strengthens the innovation ecosystem, a second phase of the project was planned and agreed.EU4Innovation (Phase II), is financed by the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III) 2021-2027 for Window 4: Competitiveness and inclusive growth, Thematic Priority 2: private sector development, trade, research, and innovation. In line with the pre-defined objectives and results outlined in the Action document, the overall objective (impact) of the Action is to increase the competitiveness and post-COVID socio-economic recovery of Albania through improvement of the business environment, innovation ecosystem and investment climate.This Multi Donor Action is jointly co-financed by the European Union (EU), the Federal Ministry of Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ) and Swedish International Development Agency (Sida).

Although the country has made some visible progress over the last years, there are still major constraints such as little investment in connectivity and weak capacities of the Government, fragile legal and regulatory digital framework and corresponding enforcement, lack of digital literacy, gender and urban-rural divides, low affordability of broadband-enabled devices, low education levels and low electrification rate. Furthermore, Mozambique¿s digital ecosystem for enterprises is dynamic, but the opportunities for start-ups are limited due to financial and business enabling environment constraints. The COVID-19-related acceleration in digitalization makes it clear that it is crucial to close the digital divide with least developed countries (LDCs) since harnessing digital technologies is crucial for sustainable development and inclusive growth.","VaMOZ Digital! VAMOZ DIGITAL! Mozambique remains one of the bottom ten countries in the world in terms of human development, aggravated by increasing inequality in recent years, including significant gender differences, Gini-coefficient rose to 0.56 (2014/15) from 0.47 (2008/9), placing Mozambique among the most unequal countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, substantial disparities between North and south and urban versus rural areas. Despite its remarkably young age structure, its potential to contribute to the country¿s socio and economic development is far from being reached. The country is one of the poorest and most unequal in the world and rapid population growth is exerting extra pressure on job creation and service delivery. In order to unleash the full potential of the youth, Mozambique needs to kick-start its digital transformation. Although the country has made some visible progress over the last years, there are still major constraints such as little investment in connectivity and weak capacities of the Government, fragile legal and regulatory digital framework and corresponding enforcement, lack of digital literacy, gender and urban-rural divides, low affordability of broadband-enabled devices, low education levels and low electrification rate. Furthermore, Mozambique¿s digital ecosystem for enterprises is dynamic, but the opportunities for start-ups are limited due to financial and business enabling environment constraints. The COVID-19-related acceleration in digitalization makes it clear that it is crucial to close the digital divide with least developed countries (LDCs) since harnessing digital technologies is crucial for sustainable development and inclusive growth. The experience indicates that when appropriately applied, digital technologies can improve lives by empowering youth, women and girls, enhancing democratic governance and transparency, and boosting productivity and job creation. The EU will not only mainstream digital technologies in all its interventions in Mozambique over the coming years, as recommended by the study commissioned in 2021, but will also actively contribute to Mozambique¿s digital transformation through support to the emergence of digital technology focusing on policy and regulatory frameworks, connectivity, e-services, digital skills and entrepreneurship. Digital skills and entrepreneurship are engines for social and economic development and thus crucial for the youth's entry into the job market. To this end, the Overall Objective (Impact) of this action contributes to Mozambique¿s inclusive growth by facilitating digital transformation. In particular, it aims to improve efficiency, effectiveness and accessibility of digital services supported by an appropriate policy and regulatory framework for digital transformation across sectors gender responsive moreover, it intends to stimulate innovation and digital entrepreneurship for youth (women and men), enabled by the appropriate skills, with a focus on those living in vulnerable situations. This action is fully in line with priority area 2 ¿Growing Youth¿, as defined in the 2021-2027 Multi-Annual Indicative Programme for Mozambique. The action will contribute to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, more specifically SDG 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent work and Economic growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and 11 (Sustainable cities and communities).",,,
